# Kmeans-Clustering-Visualization

In this project, I created a simple, 2D application to visualize how k-means clustering algorithm actually works by using one of the popular Python libraries,
called PyGame.

To run the file, make sure you already installed PyGame in your computer. If you have not, you can do it now by using the command: 

<b> pip install pygame </b>

And you're good to go.
